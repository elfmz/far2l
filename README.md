# far2l
Linux port of FAR Manager v2 (http://farmanager.com/)   
Works also on OSX and BSD (but later not tested on regular manner)   
ALPHA VERSION.   
**Currently interesting only for enthusiasts!!!**

Plug-ins that are currently working: NetRocks (SFTP/SCP/FTP/FTPS/SMB/NFS/WebDAV), colorer, multiarc, tmppanel, align, autowrap, drawline, editcase, SimpleIndent, Python (optional scripting support)

#### License: GNU/GPLv2

### Used code from projects

* FAR for Windows
* WINE
* ANSICON
* Portable UnRAR
* 7z ANSI-C Decoder

## Contributing, Hacking
#### Required dependencies

* gawk
* m4
* libglib2.0-dev
* libwxgtk3.0-dev
* libssh-dev (needed for NetRocks/SFTP)
* libsmbclient-dev (needed for NetRocks/SMB)
* libnfs-dev (needed for NetRocks/NFS)
* libneon27-dev (or later, needed for NetRocks/WebDAV)
* cmake ( >= 3.2.2 )
* g++
* git (needed for downloading source code)

#### Or simply on Ubuntu:
``` sh
apt-get install gawk m4 libglib2.0-dev libwxgtk3.0-dev libssh-dev libsmbclient-dev libnfs-dev libneon27-dev cmake g++ git
```

#### Clone and Build

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/elfmz/far2l
cd far2l
mkdir build
cd build
```
_with make:_
``` sh
cmake -DUSEWX=yes -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4
``` 
_or with ninja (you need **ninja-build** package installed)_
``` sh
cmake -DUSEWX=yes -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja ..
ninja -j4
```

#### OSX install

 * Supported compiler: ```AppleClang 8.0.0.x``` or newer. Check your version, and install/update XCode if necessary.
 ```sh
 clang++ -v
 ```

 * Install Homebrew if you don't have it:
```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

##### One line OSX install

 * Install stable far2l via unofficial brew tap:
```sh
brew install yurikoles/yurikoles/far2l
```

 * Latest git master can be installed via:
```sh
brew install yurikoles/yurikoles/far2l --HEAD
```

##### Hard way OSX install - with building from sources:
 * Install required packages:
```sh
brew install cmake gawk glib ninja pkg-config wget wxmac libssh libnfs neon
```

 * Clone:
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/elfmz/far2l
cd far2l
mkdir build
cd build
```
_with make:_
``` sh
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DUSEWX=yes -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4
``` 
_or with ninja_
``` sh
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DUSEWX=yes -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Ninja ..
ninja -j4
```

To build without WX backend (console version only): change -DUSEWX=yes to -DUSEWX=no

To build with Python plugin: add argument -DPYTHON=yes

Building with MacPorts (when wxWidgets.framework is not installed system-wide):

``` sh
cmake .. \
  -DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/wxWidgets.framework/Versions/wxWidgets/3.1/bin/wx-config \
  -DwxWidgets_wxrc_EXECUTABLE=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/wxWidgets.framework/Versions/wxWidgets/3.1/bin/wxrc
```

#### IDE Setup
You can import the project into your favourite IDE like QtCreator, CodeLite, or any other, which supports cmake or which cmake is able to generate projects for.

 * **QtCreator**: select "Open Project" and point QtCreator to the CMakeLists.txt in far2l root directory
 * **CodeLite**: use this guide to setup a project: http://codelite.org/LiteEditor/WorkingWithCMake (to avoid polluting your source tree, don't create your workspace inside of the far2l directory)

#### Useful add-ons

 * A collection of macros: https://github.com/corporateshark/far2l-macros

## Notes on porting

I implemented/borrowed from WINE some commonly used WinAPI functions. They are all declared in WinPort/WinPort.h and corresponding defines can be found in WinPort/WinCompat.h (both are included by WinPort/windows.h). Note that this stuff may not be 1-to-1 to corresponding Win32 functionality also doesn't provide full-UNIX functionality, but it simplifies porting and can be considered as temporary scaffold.

However, only the main executable is linked statically to WinPort, although it also _exports_ WinPort functionality, so plugins use it without the neccessity to bring their own copies of this code. This is the reason that each plugin's binary should not statically link to WinPort.

While FAR internally is UTF16 (because WinPort contains UTF16-related stuff), native Linux wchar_t size is 4 bytes (rather than 2 bytes) so potentially Linux FAR may be fully UTF32-capable console interaction in the future, but while it uses Win32-style UTF16 functions it does not. However, programmers need to be aware that wchar_t is not 2 bytes long anymore.

Inspect all printf format strings: unlike Windows, in Linux both wide and multibyte printf-like functions have the same multibyte and wide specifiers. This means that %s is always multibyte while %ls is always wide. So, any %s used in wide-printf-s or %ws used in any printf should be replaced with %ls.

Update from 27aug: now it's possible by defining WINPORT_DIRECT to avoid renaming used Windows API and also to avoid changing format strings as swprintf will be intercepted by a compatibility wrapper.

## Plugin API
Plugins API based on FAR Manager v2 plus following changes:
### Added following entries to FarStandardFunctions:

* int Execute(const wchar_t *CmdStr, unsigned int ExecFlags);
...where ExecFlags - combination of values of EXECUTEFLAGS.
Executes given command line, if EF_HIDEOUT and EF_NOWAIT are not specified then command will be executed on far2l virtual terminal.

* int ExecuteLibrary(const wchar_t *Library, const wchar_t *Symbol, const wchar_t *CmdStr, unsigned int ExecFlags)
Executes given shared library symbol in separate process (process creation behaviour is the same as for Execute).
symbol function must be defined as: int 'Symbol'(int argc, char *argv[])

* void DisplayNotification(const wchar_t *action, const wchar_t *object);
Shows (depending on settings - always or if far2l in background) system shell-wide notification with given title and text.

* int DispatchInterThreadCalls();
far2l supports calling APIs from different threads by marshalling API calls from non-main threads into main one and dispatching them on main thread at certain known-safe points inside of dialog processing loops. DispatchInterThreadCalls() allows plugin to explicitely dispatch such calls and plugin must use it periodically in case it blocks main thread with some non-UI activity that may wait for other threads.

### Added following commands into FILE_CONTROL_COMMANDS:
* FCTL_GETPANELPLUGINHANDLE
Can be used to interract with plugin that renders other panel.
hPlugin can be set to PANEL_ACTIVE or PANEL_PASSIVE.
Param1 ignored.
Param2 points to value of type HANDLE, call sets that value to handle of plugin that renders specified panel or INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE.

### Added following plugin-exported functions:
* int MayExitFARW();
far2l asks plugin if it can exit now. If plugin has some background tasks pending it may block exiting of far2l, however it highly recommended to give user choice using UI prompt.

### Added following dialog messages:
* DM_GETCOLOR - retrieves get current color attributes of selected dialog item
* DM_SETCOLOR - changes current color attributes of selected dialog item
