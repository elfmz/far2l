 #Case sensitive#            - Search for case sensitive text.
 #Restart search beyond EOF# - Plugin will continue to search for the string from the beginning of file if searching forward or from the end of file if searching backward up to the current match if pattern was not found.
 #Keep selection#            - After search is finished upon plugin completion found text will remain selected.
 #Beep on mismatch#          - Make a beep if pattern was not found.
 #Use selected block#        - Initialize search pattern with a block selected, if any. Line containing the selection must be the current line. If block has more than one line only the current one will be used.

$^#Interface and Keyboard reference#
 When in incremental search mode the leftmost characters of the top line will display the prompt #^:#. Start typing the search string and it will be displayed after this prompt.

 When found the match will be scrolled to view in editor and selected with a block. Message #[Not found]# will be displayed at the editor's status line otherwise. After succeeded search, which was crossing end or beginning of file, the #[EOF]# or #[BOF]# message will be displayed at status line.

 Any character, which is neither a possible pattern symbol nor a plugin's control key, will be bypassed to FAR which will terminate plugin.
