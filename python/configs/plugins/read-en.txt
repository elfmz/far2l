A. Python plugin
The python plugin has only one purpose - to facilitate the writing of scripts that extend the capabilities of FAR2L.

B. Logging and logger configuration
There is a logger.ini file in the Plugins/python/plug/far2l directory, you can set your own log information preferences there.
By default, the log is saved to the file /tmp/far2l-py.

C. Fundamentals
*.py files from this directory should be copied to the directory:
~/.config/far2l/plugins/python - The default directory for python plugins from which they can be easily activated.

a) the plugins are loaded with the command "py:load filename" for example py:load ucharmap
b) unloading the plugin is done with the command "py:unload filename" for example py:unload ucharmap

D. Examples
a) ucharmap.py - an example plugin showing whole UTF-8 character set
    F11 + "Python Character Map" - display its dialog
    Offset - position in the character set
    Goto - change position - decimal or hexadecimal number or 1 character is allowed, valid range is <0x0000-0xffff>
    Keys:
        Home = goto first visible offset
        PgUp = prevoius page
        PgDn = next page
        Left = prevoius character in row
        Right = next character in row
        Up = prevoius row
        Down = next row
        ENTER/OK = copy character at aooset into clipboard
    Mouse:
        Click - select character at pointer position
b) udialog.py - plugin with two examples, dialog and command line extensions "py:dialog" and "py:exec python.script.goes.here"
    F11 + "Python udialog" - will display the first dialog
    py:dialog - will display a second dialog with one input element
    py:exec ...- will execute the python exec command
c) upanel.py - how to create a simple VFS (virtual file system) - plugin accessible from the Disk Menu (Python upanel) of FAR2L
d) udebug.py - how to debug plugins? - see read-udebug-en.txt or read-udebug-pl.txt
